In this lab, we went over the basics of using GitHub. This included: creating an online repository, cloning said repository on our device locally, locally edit files and push them to our online repository, create a new branch, modify files in said branch, merge the two branches, and push them to the online repository. Not sure what else to say, still don't fully understand Git and what we all did, but I am trying hahaha.
